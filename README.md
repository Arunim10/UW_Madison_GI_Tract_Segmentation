# UW_Madison_GI_Tract_Segmentation
Deep learning-based solution for automatic segmentation of stomach and intestines in MRI scans to streamline MR-Linac guided radiotherapy and improve cancer treatment efficiency.

This repository hosts the code and solutions for an exciting deep learning project focused on improving cancer treatment using MRI-guided radiotherapy. The competition, supported by the UW-Madison Carbone Cancer Center, aims to create models that automatically segment the stomach and intestines on MRI scans, helping oncologists deliver more precise and efficient radiation therapy.

ðŸš€ Motivation
Each year, millions of people are diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers, and approximately half of them undergo radiation therapy. Modern technologies like MR-Linacs allow radiation oncologists to visualize tumors and surrounding organs in real-time. However, adjusting the radiation beams daily to avoid healthy tissues like the stomach and intestines is a painstaking manual process.

This competition challenges participants to develop a method to automate this segmentation process, reducing treatment times and enabling better care for patients.

ðŸ©º About the Competition
Dataset:
The dataset consists of anonymized MRI scans from actual cancer patients, taken during 1â€“5 sessions across their radiation treatment period.

Scans include variations in tumor and organ positioning across days.
Ground truth annotations outline the stomach and intestines, enabling supervised learning approaches.
Objective:
Develop a model that can accurately segment the stomach and intestines from MRI scans to assist in precise dose delivery and minimize damage to healthy tissues.

Real-World Impact:

Speeds up radiation therapy sessions from 1 hour to approximately 15 minutes.
Improves treatment tolerability for patients.
Enables hospitals to treat more patients efficiently.
